AnimaitonRadioactivityiLab
==========================

animaiton simulator of UQ Radioactivity iLab

This project is a subproject of iLab in UQ. The application I developped is based on the senior laboratory supervisor Len Payne's work().

I inserted my code into DriverRadioactivity.java and DeviceFlexMotionSimulation in Radioactivity_LibraryLabEquipment.
They use classes in LabServerMQTT project(which I wrote).

There might be some .jar should be included in libraries for peojects to compile and run it. They are stored in Java folder.
