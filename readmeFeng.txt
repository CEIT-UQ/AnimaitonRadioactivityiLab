I inserted my code into DriverRadioactivity.java and DeviceFlexMotionSimulation in Radioactivity_LibraryLabEquipment.They use classes in LabServerMQTT project(which I wrote).

There might be some .jar should be included in libraries for peojects to compile and run it. I copy them into Java folder.
